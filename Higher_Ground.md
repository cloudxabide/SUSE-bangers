## Lyrics
<pre>
Nerds, keep on learnin
Linux servers, keep on servin
The network, keep on pingin
'Cause SUSE won't let you down

Open source, keep on growin
Choice Happens, keep on showin
The Gecko, mean and greenin'
'Cause SUSE won't let you down

[chorus]
Container's not startin, better try it again
CrashLoopBackOff and they're dyin within
Push to the repo and we're tryin again
Keep on tryin, Til we reach a higher ground

[verse 2]
Enterprises, keep on trusting
While our code keeps on pushing
The distro, keep on thriving
'Cause SUSE won't let you down, oh-no

Code.... keep on forking
Party repos... you best believin'
More code will come along
'Cause SUSE won't let you down, fo-show

SUSE-teachers, a-keep on teachin'
SUSE-preachers, a-keep on preachin'
World, keep on turnin'
'Cause SUSE won't let you down, fo-show

[outro]
Open Source Gurus say...Nobody is smarter than all of us
Collaboration is the way
